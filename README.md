# vagrant-s-enda

Starts the S-ENDA specific software in a one node Kubernetes cluster based on [`k3s`](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s).

This is meant for testing ingestion of metadata locally. More information about the S-ENDA project on the documentation pages [Welcome to S-ENDAâ€™s documentation!](https://s-enda-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Usage

```bash
vagrant up
```

### Commands available

All commands can be run from the `vagrant` user inside the VM.

* [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/) --- used as backend for `k3s`.
* [`kubectl`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl) --- to interact with Kubernets.
* [`k9s`](https://github.com/derailed/k9s) --- for a terminal menu based interaction with Kubernetes.
